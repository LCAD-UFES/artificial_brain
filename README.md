# Artificial brain
This repository describes the architecture of an experimental robotic platform.

## Goal
Create an experimental environment to develop an artificial brain which is ablewith basic human-machine interactions.

## High-level requirements


## Physical architecture
The physical architecure was designed using the [Eclipse Capella](https://www.eclipse.org/capella/) tool (version 5.2.0) following the [Arcadia](https://www.eclipse.org/capella/arcadia.html) systems engineering methodology.

Figure below illustrates the main components of the physical architecture highlighting both the allocation of physical functions (green boxes) into software components (blue boxes) and the allocation of software components (blue boxes) into hardware components (yellow boxes). The architecture also indicates the main physical interfaces between the hardware components.
